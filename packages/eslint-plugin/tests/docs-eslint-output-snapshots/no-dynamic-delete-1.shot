Correct

const container: { [i: string]: number } = {
  /* ... */
};

// Constant runtime lookups by string index
delete container.aaa;

// Constants that must be accessed by []
delete container[7];
delete container[-1];

// All strings are allowed, to be compatible with the noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature
// TS compiler option
delete container['aaa'];
delete container['Infinity'];
